## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue] + [Vite](https://vuejs.org/) -  Js framework  



### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/) - This helped me for making a responsive layout and many more. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [fedmentor.dev](https://fedmentor.dev/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to ask for help(and actually get it!). I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
